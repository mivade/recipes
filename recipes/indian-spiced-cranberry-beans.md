# Indian-spiced cranberry beans

## Ingredients

- 1 pound cranberry beans, cooked with their broth
- 1 medium yellow onion, sliced or diced
- 2 serrano chiles, sliced
- 8 garlic cloves, diced
- 3 inch piece of fresh ginger, diced
- 6 fresh or canned plum tomatoes, chopped and drained
- Spices
	- 4 cardamom pods
	- 4 teaspoons cumin seeds
	- 2 teaspoons fennel seeds
	- 2 teaspoons coriander seeds
- Oil
- Salt and black pepper to taste

## Instructions

- Gently warm the beans in their broth in a pot.
- Heat oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Sautee onion, garlic, ginger,
  and chiles until soft and fragrant (10-15 minutes).
- While the vegetables are being sauteed, lightly grind all the spices with a
  mortar and pestle.
- When the vegetables are ready, raise the heat to medium-high and add the
  ground spices and tomatoes and cook, stirring (2-5 minutes).
- Add spice mixture to beans and add salt and pepper to taste.
- Continue cooking the beans for about 10 minutes to allow flavors to blend.
  Optionally crush some of the beans against the side of the pot to help
  thicken.
